### üìç Try The Demo! [![Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p3f5F3fIw9CD7H4RvfnHO9g-J45qUPHp?usp=sharing)

## Description

GeoCLIP-Plus builds on the original GeoCLIP model by incorporating advanced features that enhance usability and expand functionality. This version introduces more user-friendly interfaces and additional utilities, designed to streamline the workflow for geospatial data analysis and visualization.

## Method

Similarly to OpenAI's CLIP, GeoCLIP is trained contrastively by matching Image-GPS pairs. By using the MP-16 dataset, composed of 4.7M Images taken across the globe, GeoCLIP learns distinctive visual features associated with different locations on earth.

## üìé Getting Started: API

You can install GeoCLIP's module using pip:

```
pip install geoclip
```

or directly from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/VicenteVivan/geo-clip
cd geo-clip
python setup.py install
```

![ALT TEXT](/figures/inference.png)

### Usage: GeoCLIP Inference

```python
import torch
from geoclip import GeoCLIP

model = GeoCLIP()

image_path = "image.png"

top_pred_gps, top_pred_prob = model.predict(image_path, top_k=5)

print("Top 5 GPS Predictions")
print("=====================")
for i in range(5):
    lat, lon = top_pred_gps[i]
    print(f"Prediction {i+1}: ({lat:.6f}, {lon:.6f})")
    print(f"Probability: {top_pred_prob[i]:.6f}")
    print("")
```

## üåê Worldwide GPS Embeddings

In our paper, we show that once trained, our location encoder can assist other geo-aware neural architectures. Specifically, we explore our location encoder's ability to improve multi-class classification accuracy. We achieved state-of-the-art results on the Geo-Tagged NUS-Wide Dataset by concatenating GPS features from our pre-trained location encoder with an image's visual features. Additionally, we found that the GPS features learned by our location encoder, even without extra information, are effective for geo-aware image classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the GPS-only multi-class classification task on the same dataset.

### Usage: Pre-Trained Location Encoder

```python
import torch
from geoclip import LocationEncoder

gps_encoder = LocationEncoder()

gps_data = torch.Tensor([[40.7128, -74.0060], [34.0522, -118.2437]])  # NYC and LA in lat, lon
gps_embeddings = gps_encoder(gps_data)
print(gps_embeddings.shape) # (2, 512)
```
